# Regenerate the Longhouse client libraries for every language csilgen can
# package, into clients/<lang>/. Each output dir is a self-contained,
# dependency-free package (manifest + barrel + types + codec + client) — the
# generated codec owns the wire, so there is no csilgen-transport dependency to
# vendor or pin. Run from any directory.
#
#   clients/<lang>/    one publishable client package per language
#
# csilgen is treated as an ordinary system tool (like docker/gofmt): it must be
# on PATH. Install it from the repo if missing — see the error below.
#
# Coordinates (package name, module path, version) are per-language because each
# ecosystem has its own name grammar; we splice a language-specific options block
# onto the shared spec for each generation rather than committing 14 option sets
# into longhouse.csil (which is also consumed by the api server generation, and
# must stay free of emit_packages — see csil/regenerate.sh).
